# Chase W. Norton

**From predicting Hawaiian hurricanes to building AI that sells shit.**

Currently: Co-Founder & CTO @ [Hana](https://hanahq.ai) ‚Äî bringing actual intelligence to e-commerce (not just another chatbot).

Previously: Built [Message AI](https://messageai.io) when everyone thought SMS was dead. Turns out people like texting their AI. ü§∑

## The Non-Linear Path

**2011-2012:** Published in *Journal of Geophysical Research*
Studying Hawaiian climate patterns and extreme precipitation. Built neural networks to predict weather before it was cool to build neural networks.

**2012-2018:** Founded & Led Chase Life
Ran a web dev company in Hawaii, building sites for local businesses. Managed a team of 5. Learned how to ship on deadlines, deal with clients who "just want it to look like Apple," and why you should always get 50% upfront.

**2018-2022:** Staff Engineer @ PayPal
Shipped multi-user experiences, merchant tooling, and customer satisfaction systems for enterprise-scale commerce. Got 11 Bravo awards. Mentored engineers. Realized big companies move slow.

**2022-2023:** Founded Geexe Development ‚Üí Shipped Message AI
Built an AI-powered texting platform before ChatGPT made it trendy. SMS, WhatsApp, voice. Privacy-first, GDPR-compliant, with a mood/intent engine because context matters. Scaled it. Learned hard lessons about consumer AI.

**2023-2024:** Staff Engineer @ Mix.com & Nuna Inc
Built personalized web experiences with ML. Worked on healthcare data infrastructure.

**2025:** Building Hana
AI-first e-commerce that actually converts. Not a support bot. Not a recommendation widget. An agent that guides, compares, and closes sales. We're applying to YC S25 and actively recruiting badass engineers.

## What I Actually Believe

**"Build MVPs like they're destined for success."**
In the age of agentic AI, small teams can ship quality engineering from day one. "Move fast and break things" is dead. "Move fast and build it right" is the new game.

**Agents > Assistants**
If your AI can't take action, it's just a fancy search bar.

**Ship or die**
Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. Show me what you've built.

## Currently Recruiting

We're hiring engineers who give a shit about craft AND speed:

| Role | What We Need |
|------|-------------|
| **Senior Backend Engineer** | Distributed systems, APIs that don't fall over, databases that scale |
| **AI/ML Engineer** | LLMs in production, not notebooks. Evals, safety, latency budgets |
| **DevOps/Infra** | Kubernetes, cloud-native, observability that actually helps debug |
| **Full-Stack** | React/Node, design taste, shipping features end-to-end |

**Email me:** chase@hanahq.ai
**Subject:** "I built [thing that impressed people]"
**Body:** Link to it and why you're proud of it.

No cover letters. No recruiter speak. Show me what you ship.

## The Stack I Use

Building with: **Python** ‚Ä¢ **TypeScript** ‚Ä¢ **React** ‚Ä¢ **Node.js** ‚Ä¢ **AWS** ‚Ä¢ **OpenAI** ‚Ä¢ **PyTorch** ‚Ä¢ **LangChain** ‚Ä¢ **Vector DBs**

But honestly, stack matters less than knowing when to use what. I've written more bad Python than good Python. Still shipping.

## Things I've Written About

- AI SDK generation (compiling clean APIs from messy specs)
- Enterprise AI rollout patterns (because YOLO doesn't work in prod)
- Why most AI commerce tools are just expensive theater
- How to build pseudo-memory for scalable conversational agents

I write **[The Intelligent Shift](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/the-intelligent-shift-7187189724093444096/)** ‚Äî a daily-ish newsletter on AI that cuts through the hype. 351 subscribers who probably hate-read it.

---

## Education (Because Apparently This Matters)

- **M.S. Applied Machine Learning** ‚Äî University of Hawaii at Manoa
- **M.S. Software Engineering** ‚Äî Harvard Extension School

Built neural networks for climate research. Turns out they're also good at selling things. Who knew?

## If You're Still Reading

You either:
1. Are considering hiring me (I'm not looking, but I'll hear cool ideas)
2. Want to work with me (see "Currently Recruiting" above)
3. Are procrastinating on actual work (same, honestly)
