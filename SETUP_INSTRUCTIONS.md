# 🏆 Your Four Seasons Level GitHub Profile Setup Guide

Welcome Chase! I've created a luxurious, professional GitHub profile README that will make your profile stand out with elegance and sophistication.

## ✨ What I've Created for You

```

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Your Profile Repository
```bash

# Create the repo on GitHub (make it PUBLIC!)
gh repo create ChaseWNorton --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions
After pushing, your Actions will automatically run. The snake animation will appear after the first run (within 6 hours or trigger manually).

### 3. Optional Enhancements

2. Get your API key from settings
3. Add it to your repo secrets: Settings → Secrets → New secret

#### 📊 Recent Activity Section
To add a recent activity section, add this to your README where you want it to appear:

```markdown

<!--END_SECTION:activity-->
```
